                                        Take a look at this map. There exist many important maritime shipping routes
                                        for
                                        global commerce! This brings us to our first issue with geography:

                                    <span>Time for a new glossary term: the <span id="term-resource-curse"><b>resource
                                                curse</b></span>. The resource curse states that countries rich in

                                        political and social outcomes. <i>In simpler terms</i>, scholars have found

                                        But wait, we said that was paradoxical for a reason... why would a country

                                        access to resources to help it thrive somehow be worse off than its "less

                                                much, much more ice cream in your lunchbox than your friends, and
                                                they're willing to pay you good money for your ice cream. Either you

                                                you'd sell (export) some of your ice cream and keep the rest of it
                                                for

                                    didn't move to the colonies and instead exploited them for their resources from
