<br>What domestic factors‚Äîcircumstances within a nation‚Äîimpact its development?

<ol type="1">
    <li>Geography and History</li>
    <br>What role do you think geography plays in development?<br><button>Reveal</button>
    <br><img src="/public/maritime-routes.png" alt="Main Maritime Shipping Routes and Checkpoints. Dr. Jean-Paul Rodrigue" width="500"></br>
    Take a look at this map. There exist many important maritime shipping routes for global commerce! This brings us to our first issue with geography: <b>landlocked nations are cut off from maritime trade routes</b>. As a result, they aren't able to trade as efficiently on a global scale. Trading becomes more expensive and reduced interaction with the global market can hinder economic growth. 
    <br>How about history?<br><button>Reveal</button>
    <br>Time for a new glossary term: the <b>resource curse</b>. The resource curse states that countries rich in natural resources are paradoxically less developed and experience worse political and social outcomes. <i>In simpler terms</i>, scholars have found that countries that have a lot of critical resources like minerals and fossil fuels 1) are less developed (recall our definition of LDC), and 2) face more troubles in their politics (think instability and corruption!) and "social outcomes" like literacy rates and infant mortality.
    <br>But wait, we said that was paradoxical for a reason... why would a country with access to resources to help it thrive somehow be worse off than its "less resource rich" counterpart?
    <br>Here are a couple of explanations:
    <ul><i>Corruption:</i><br> Imagine you're at your elementary school lunch table. You happen to have much, much more ice cream in your lunchbox than your friends, and they're willing to pay you good money for your ice cream. Either you can sell your ice cream, or you can eat it, satisfying your taste buds.<br>
    <br>Now, imagine that the ice cream is oil, you and your peers represent countries, and your taste buds are your constituents. In an ideal world, you'd sell (export) some of your ice cream and keep the rest of it for your taste buds (internal investment). But the idea here is that you are <b>corrupt</b>, so instead of investing into your nation (feeding your taste buds), you profit off of exporting the resource. You choose profits over improving your nation through investment because ü§ë.</ul>
    <ul><i>Colonialism:</i><br> Country A has an abundance of natural resources. Country B colonizes Country A. The colonists then exploit Country A's resources, often through enumeration (Country A can only trade with Country B, paying more for what they consume and less for what they sell, ultimately weakening Country A), which leaves Country A at a developmental disadvantage that makes it an LDC.</ul>
    <li>Colonialism</li>
    <br>Colonialism plays such a major role in development that it deserves a section of its own, separate from history.
    <ul><i>Arbitrary Borders:</i><br> Let's go back to the lunch table. About half of the table consists of your friends; you share the same hobbies, interests, and even favorite color! The other half of the table, though? They're fine, but you don't get along all that well. This arrangement is fine though. At least, it was fine until a teacher came and randomly separated your tablemates into two groups.<br>
    <br>In this instance, you and your peers represent, well, yourselves, your lunch table is a country, and your teacher represents a colonizing nation. The colonizing nation (your teacher) just placed arbitrary borders in your nation (lunch table), regrouping you your peers. There's now a good chance that you've been brought together with peers you don't get along with, and the strength your existing friend group had is now diminished because you're divided. This leads to conflict. In international relations, if there are ethnic differences between the divided individuals, the division yields <i>ethnic conflict</i>, hindering or even reversing development through the struggles that come with conflict.</ul>
    <ul><i>Local Climate:</i><br>Place matters. <br> Colonies with <i>tropical climates</i> often suffered from poor soil and disease, resulting in difficulties or death among colonists. As a result, the colonists didn't move to the colonies and instead exploited them for their resources from afar. This situation is called <b>extraction</b>.
    <br>In contrast, a colony with a more hospitable climate attracted colonists who still exploited the colonized nation. This exploitation was paired with long-term arrangements to live in the colony (<b>movement</b>), though, resulting in less extractive economies and potentially setting the colony up for long-term economic success.</ul>
    <li>Government Policies</li>
    Government policies play a role in development, too!<br>More specifically, policies that support <b>infrastructure</b>, or the basic structures necessary for social activity, such as transportation and telecommunications networks, and power and water supply, tend to help bolster development.<br>Countries that have a reliable and dependable set of laws (<b>rule of law</b>) and punishments also tend to be more develpoed, as the citizens gain a sense of protection from issues such as predatory business practices, furthering social and economic progress.<br>A country's regime type also may yield wealth differences. For instance, a democracy's emphases on fairness and accountability may also further progress, supporting development.
