                    as it turns out, it all comes down to the international <i>economy</i>.

                    <br>Now that we have the background required to understand the international economy, let's
                    break down two sets of economic policies that countries adopted for international trade in prior
                    decades and understand how they've impacted national development.
                    <ol type="1" class="expandable-list numbered">
                        <li class="expandable-list-tab">
                            <div class="expandable-list-item"><span
                                    id="term-import-substituting-industrialization">Import-substituting
                                    industrialization (ISI)</span>
                                <span class="material-icons">keyboard_arrow_down</span>
                            </div>
                            <ul class="expandable-list-content">
                                This set of policies was pursued by most developing countries from the 1930s through
                                the 1980s to reduce imports and encourage domestic manufacturing, often through
                                trade barriers, subsidies to manufacturing, and state ownership of basic industries.
                                <br><br>In other words, developing nations sought to bolster their economies to spur
                                increased development. So, they imported less goods from other nations and employed
                                government policies to push for production in the nation. These policies included
                                making trade more difficult, paying manufacturing companies to keep manufacturing,
                                and taking over industries such as mining and agriculture (think primary sector) to
                                encourage these industries to operate in the nation.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>For instance, Mexico placed high tarrifs on imported (not made in Mexico)
                                        vehicles and parts from the 1960s through the 1980s. Tarriffs are price
                                        surcharges that, ultimately, are passed on to the consumer. So, these
                                        tariffs meant that vehicles produced in the country were cheaper than their
                                        counterparts manufactured elsewhere, encouraging customers to buy local.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Protectionist policies</b> are government policies that seek to bolster
                                        or ensure the stability of the local economy by safeguarding it from foreign
                                        competition (e.g., tarrifs, subsidies).</li>
                                </ul>
                            </ul>

                        <li class="expandable-list-tab">
                            <div class="expandable-list-item"><span
                                    id="term-export-oriented-industrialization">Export-oriented industrialization

                                This set of policies was originally pursued in the mid-1960s by several East Asian
                                countries to spur manufacturing for export, often through subsidies and incentives
                                for export production.
                                <br><br>In other words, these nations also sought to bolster their economies to spur
                                increased development. However, they did so by encouraging the export of goods,
                                presenting a stark contrast to ISI's less trade-friendly approach. Their policies
                                included paying companies to export their products.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>For instance, Japan encouraged automakers to export their products, which
                                        actually helped it gain an advantage in the global economy due to its
                                        ability to produce many vehicles and the world's demand for them. This
                                        advantage also translated to increased domestic economic growth, spurring
                                        development.</li>
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                    </ol>

                    So, ISI or EOI? Which set of policies do you think better helped nations develop, and why?

                            likely due to the advantages they reaped from specializing in certain products in

                            international economic cooperation, hindering development.
